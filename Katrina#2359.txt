No specific time stamps for these:
1. Can press G, R, T, or Y instead of E when trying to interact with the jellies, and it still works.
2. Music does not start up by itself even though it was on 74 as the default, had to go into the music toggle and move it around a litte, 
then it started (not in video since did not have sound on, but tried later on).

Time stamped:
(7:37)  - When I respawned after falling, I started very very high up and fell down to the map.
(10:46) - Pressed F when testing all letters on keyboard, and every jelly got enormous.
(13:08) - Could see the block that the laser comes out of come up from below after respawning and tried to jump on it when slightly below 
the map. When I did so, I got stuck into a loop where I just kept falling, getting put below the map, falling, respawning and so on. 
        - The block that the laser comes out of respawns at the same time as me and comes up from below the map
