00:15 - Terrain either completely or partially blocks view of the jelly. This happens a few more times throughout the video (05:50, 08:10).

1:00 - When you jump on the slime, the jump in disabled.

03:45 - When I opened my inventory and tried putting the green diamond where the apples (?) were, it became stuck on the screen in the top left corner and stayed there the rest of the game. Could not be clicked on to move.

09:30 - Around here I was pressing random letter keys to see what happens. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but F on the keyboard, the jellies suddenly became huge.

09:50 - This one goes with the previous issue. You can basically clip through the jelly and see through it since the hit box didn't change.

10:10 - Even though the jellies were bigger, the hit box stayed the same size as the original/small jellies. This made it a tad more difficult to interact/feed them since you had to find the right spot.

11:40 - Basically just some clipping with the large jellies. It continues on for about 20 more seconds.

13:35 - For some reason the pointer laser started up again?
