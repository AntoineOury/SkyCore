// Need this complexity because GameEventScriptableObject uses lists of System.Action
// (in order to iterate backwards so a response to an event can be to unregister.)
// Using C# events would be simpler. Whereas with lists of System.Action, need to cache
// a reference to the delegate, because typing the name of a method creates a new delegate
// instance. E.g. if a method is named Eat, list.Add(Eat) then list.Remove(Eat) wouldn't
// actually remove it from the list (I think).

// Also, can't do C# events in dictionaries, so they wouldn't work anyway, because of selective listeners.

// It's also more concise to use this than to doing a bunch of "event += MethodName" to register and a bunch
// of "event -= MethodName" to unregister.
