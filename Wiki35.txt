What needs to be improved & found bugs:
-- horrible optimization (that is why my video is not 15 minutes long â€“ I just could not stand the laggy screen)
-- [0:00] the sound bars in the sound menu should be draggable because it is intuitive;
-- [0:29] the game could use alpha walls to prevent from falling from the platform;
-- [0:45] once, after jumping, I was stuck in the sky (I had to press some key to fall);
-- [1:06] sometimes I could not collect berries;
-- [1:30] sometimes feeding the jelly was laggy;
-- [1:44] no music.

My laptop specification:
MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013)
Processor: 2.6 GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7
RAM: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
Graphics: Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB & NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2 GB

I used the Parallels Desktop 18 and Windows 11 to run the game, meaning my laptop resources were halved.
